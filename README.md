# Machine_Learning
This repository has the simple deep learning python scripts

#### ML_HW_mnist : Hello world of machine learning to recognize handwriiten digits, 512 hidden layers, 28*28 input images, 10 output layer for 10 digits, using softmax activation to the output layer, relu for the hidden layers.

#### Accuracy, Specificity, and Sensitivity Calculation of Multiclass Classfier reading output from a CSV file

#### ML_IMDB_review: file contains an example of binary classifier (positive or negative) and good example to show overfitting using training and validation data, loss vs epochs and accuracy vs epochs are alos shown in the two figure files
