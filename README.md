# Machine Learning Projects
This repository has the simple deep learning python scripts

## ML_HW_mnist : Hello world of machine learning to recognize handwriiten digits, different algorithm is being used to compare the accuracy and to tune the hyperparameters using kaggle handwrittendigits dataset. Current progress of this project is the following:
1. linear SVM based recognition: implemented
2. Kernal based SVM: implemented
3. gridsearch to improve SVM parameters: implemented
4. xgboost based recognition: implemented
5. LENET5 modified: implemented
6. custom NN: implemented (best result so far: 99.41%
7. To do: data augmentation and evaluate the already developed algorithm above
8. To do: ensemble NN with data augmentation.

## generating a nice looking confusion matrix using this custom function
1. A function is written to generate a nice looking confusion matrix plot.

## ML_IMDB_review: file contains an example of binary classifier (positive or negative) and good example to show overfitting using training and validation data, loss vs epochs and accuracy vs epochs are alos shown in the two figure files
