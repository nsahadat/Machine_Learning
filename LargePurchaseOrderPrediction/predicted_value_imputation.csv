92373, A professor and recently graduated Masters student at the University of
Redlands are developing the âWhale mAPP,â a web and mobile
application that will allow anyone with a GPS-enabled smart phone to act
as a citizen scientist and record whales or other marine mammals they
spot and where they spotted them.  A prototype of the app and
website has already been developed.  This grant will support
compiling the educational content and lesson plans, redesigning the
website and app to function smoothly and be user-friendly, piloting it
with 70-300 students in southern California onboard whale watching
boats, and promoting it to teachers, whale researchers, and
whale-watching adults., 86111802.0, 86000000.0, ","
